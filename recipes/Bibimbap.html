      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
         Korean bibimbap, along with kimchi, takes its place among the favored
         foods in Korean cuisine.<br />
         Meaning mixed rice, bibimbap is a popular meal consisting of white rice
         topped with vegetables, <br />beef, a whole egg, and gochujang (red
         chili pepper paste). You can substitute with soy sauce or<br />
         Sriracha (rooster sauce) for those who cannot handle the spiciness,
         like our children.
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>1 English cucumber, cut into matchsticks</li>

            2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste), divided (Optional)
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Direction</h2>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>
         Stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <p>
         Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir
         in spinach; cook until bright green and <br />wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.
         Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach
         aside in a<br />
         bowl and stir in soy sauce..
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <p>
         Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir
         carrots until< softened, about 3 minutes.<br />
         Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in
         cucumber mixture; sprinkle with red pepper<br />
         flakes. Set mixture aside in a bowl.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <p>
         Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5
         minutes per side; set aside.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 5</h3>
      <p>
         Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over
         medium-low heat. Fry eggs <br />just on one side until yolks are runny,
         but whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6</h3>
      <p>
         Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach
         mixture, a few pieces of beef, and<br />
         cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with
         1 teaspoon sesame oil, a <br />sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small
         amount of gochujang paste if desired.
