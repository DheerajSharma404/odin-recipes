      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
         This casserole is the perfect winter dinner! It's gone in seconds in my
         house. Make sure to use whole-milk ricotta and use more red pepper if
         you like it hotter.
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>1 (12 ounce) box jumbo pasta shells</li>
         <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
         <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
         <li>1 pound Italian sausage, hot or sweet</li>
         <li>1 small yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
         <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
         <li>1 (26 ounce) jar prepared marinara sauce</li>
         <li>1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
         <li>1 (15 ounce) container whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
         <li>
            ¼ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano plus additional for serving
         </li>
         <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
         <li>1 ½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
         <li>cooking spray</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Direction</h2>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>
         Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Set a rack in the
         center of the oven, about 10 inches from the heat source.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <p>
         Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook,
         stirring occasionally, until almost tender, about 7 minutes.<br />
         Scoop out 1/2 cup cooking water; set aside. Drain pasta in a colander.
         Return to pot and toss with 1 tablespoon oil.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <p>
         Meanwhile, heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large Dutch oven over
         medium-high heat. Add sirloin and sausage and cook,<br />
         undisturbed, until bottom side is lightly browned, about 6 minutes.
         Stir, and continue to cook, <br />stirring and breaking up meat into
         smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, about 4
         minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <p>
         Reduce heat to medium. Add onion and garlic, and cook, stirring often,
         until softened, about 4 minutes. <br />Stir in marinara sauce, basil,
         and crushed red pepper. Remove ragu from heat.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 5</h3>
      <p>
         Stir together ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, cream, and salt in a bowl.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6</h3>
      <p>
         To assemble, spread about 2 cups of the ragu in the bottom of a 13- x
         9-inch baking dish. Spoon 1/2 of the pasta over sauce. Dollop<br />
         half of the ricotta mixture over pasta, and sprinkle with 1 cup
         mozzarella cheese. Spoon remaining pasta over mozzarella cheese.<br />
         Spread remaining ragu over pasta mixture, and dollop with remaining
         ricotta mixture. Top with remaining> 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.<br />
         Cover lasagna with a large sheet of aluminum foil that's been lightly
         sprayed with cooking spray (to prevent the cheese from sticking to it).
      </p>
      <h3>Step 7</h3>
      <p>
         PBake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and remove
         foil.<br />
         Increase oven temperature to broil with rack about 10 inches from heat
         source; preheat 5 minutes.<br />
         Return baking dish to oven. Broil until cheese is browned in spots, 5
         to 8 minutes. I MADE IT
